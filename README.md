# Come Fly With Me :bird:
## Introduction
This is a game developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Its name is Come Fly With Me, and the main objective is to help our little red bird friend to dodge as many enemies as possible in a set time. For this demo we have limited the amount of enemies but it can be increased as far as you can imagine. In that case, you'll have to be as agile as possible. You wouldn't want to kill such a pretty creature, wouldn't you? :cry:

## Controls :gear:
The controls of this game are quite simple:

-   With :arrow_up: you 'll make our friend fly upwards.
-   With :arrow_down: you 'll make our friend fly downwards.

Easy peasy lemon squeezy!
